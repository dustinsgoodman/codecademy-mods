Question by JohnM ,

"How do I enter indented code in a Codecademy's "Ask a question" box?"

Answer by Alex J,

"In the comments you can only put plain text, no formatting. But in the questions and answers it’s easy: before typing code, click the `{}` button above the editor window:  

![](http://i.imgur.com/YANKyJS.png "click to format code")

It'll insert "backticks" (typing `` `this` `` produces `this`). If your code snippet spans across several lines (when you pasted it in from some exercise), **select all lines of code**, then click the `{}` button. That will insert four spaces at the beginning of each line.

Typing 

`⎵⎵⎵⎵print "hello"`

(where ⎵ represents a whitespace) will produce:

    print "hello"

You have to put a **blank line before and after** the indented lines.
