######**How do I write my own code now that I know $(language)?**

The way that many people write there own code is by using a text editor.  What is a text editor?  A text editor is an application that is used to write plain text files.  It is different from a word processor in the fact that it has no formatting to it.  It will only print text to a screen.

######**That sounds rather scary.  I have nothing to help me write my code?**

Yes and no.  A text editor is not some magical application that builds the code for whatever you are thinking.  However, there are plenty of text editors that have features such as syntax highlighting to help make your job as easy as can be.

######**What text editor is the best one out there?**

To be honest, there is no one text editor to rule them all.  Everyone has different preferences and different needs.  If you are only writing short three line scripts, Notepad on Windows, Gedit or Kate on Linux, and TextEdit on Mac should suffice.  All of those applications should be preinstalled on your computer.  If you are a hard-core coder who writes scripts that are hundreds of lines long spread out over multiple files, you will most likely want a more sophisticated editor.  Here it gets even more tricky depending on what you are coding.  For example, a front-end web-developer will want to use something that is built to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while someone who is writing Python applications will probably want something geared toward Python.  The following is a list of different text editors sorted by what they do best.
